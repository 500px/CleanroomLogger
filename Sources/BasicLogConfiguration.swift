     Constructs a new `BasicLogConfiguration` instance.

     - parameter minimumSeverity: The minimum `LogSeverity` supported by the
     configuration.

     - parameter filters: The `LogFilter`s to use when deciding whether a given
     `LogEntry` should be passed along to the receiver's `LogRecorder`s.

     - parameter recorders: The `LogRecorder`s to use for recording any 
     `LogEntry` that has passed the filtering process.

     - parameter synchronousMode: Determines whether synchronous mode logging
     will be used. **Use of synchronous mode is not recommended in production
     code**; it is provided for use during debugging, to help ensure that
     messages send prior to hitting a breakpoint will appear in the console
     when the breakpoint is hit.

     - parameter configurations: Optional `LogConfiguration`s. For
     organizational purposes, a given `LogConfiguration` may in turn contain
     one or more additional `LogConfiguration`s. Note that these are handled
     as entirely separate entities; the receiver's state does not affect the
     behavior of the contained configurations in any way.
